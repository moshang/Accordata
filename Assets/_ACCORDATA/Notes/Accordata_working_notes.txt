- url for current AQI data: https://taqm.epa.gov.tw/taqm/aqi-map.aspx
- can't see how to get access to the data only, so we'll scrape it out of the html from above url
- two main sonification techniques: dynamic mixing and generative music
- ideas re. generative music 
	- major triad for green aqi values
	- minor triad for yellow
	- diminished triad for orange
	- from there on adding more notes in the diminished scale as the values get higher
	- maybe use arpeggiator for this, or generate notes with unique rhythm after each time the data set loops
	- switching keys after a set numbers of bars
	- it might add to the musicality to have ritardandos mark county boundaries or data set loop points
	- hmmm, with rits probably no drum loops in support, but could work nicely to emulate a minimalist composition
	- allow the user to change synth patch
	- possibly layer data types (eg. add temperature or wind data to aqi) with different sounds or in different octaves
	- possibly do wind as synth noise with peak at the middle of the musical bar according to wind speed

- after some serious wrestling with building the required url, finally coaxed the server into giving up current AQI data

- more ideas re. generative music
	- still thinking of minimalist composers, how Philip Glass lets phrases elliptically trail off on a reverb tail in the beginning of Powaqqatsi - 13. The Unutterable 
	- the above instead of or in addition to rits to mark significant data boundaries?
	- think minimal, though more Reich than Glass 
	- instead of arpeggios, let the machine come up with a 1/2 bar phrase (melody and rhythm) that can be looped and cross-pollinated with variations of itself
	- maybe use progressively "bad" values to push the phrase progressively more out of shape

- more slicing and dicing of the raw data into easily digestible bite-sized chunks
- hmmm, this was just one data stream (AQI and lots of info on pollutants) - how many will we need? Hopefully we've got the hang of it now and additional data streams will offer up their pearls of wisdom faster

- windchimes: the original weather data sonification device
- made progress with minimalMelody
