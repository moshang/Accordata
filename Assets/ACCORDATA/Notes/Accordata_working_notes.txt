- url for current AQI data: https://taqm.epa.gov.tw/taqm/aqi-map.aspx
- can't see how to get access to the data only, so we'll scrape it out of the html from above url
- two main sonification techniques: dynamic mixing and generative music
- ideas re. generative music 
	- major triad for green AQI values
	- minor triad for yellow
	- diminished triad for orange
	- from there on adding more notes in the diminished scale as the values get higher
	- maybe use arpeggiator for this, or generate notes with unique rhythm after each time the data set loops
	- switching keys after a set numbers of bars
	- it might add to the musicality to have ritardandos mark county boundaries or data set loop points
	- hmmm, with rits probably no drum loops in support, but could work nicely to emulate a minimalist composition
	- allow the user to change synth patch
	- possibly layer data types (eg. add temperature or wind data to AQI) with different sounds or in different octaves
	- possibly do wind as synth noise with peak at the middle of the musical bar according to wind speed

- after some serious wrestling with building the required url, finally coaxed the server into giving up current AQI data

- more ideas re. generative music
	- still thinking of minimalist composers, how Philip Glass lets phrases elliptically trail off on a reverb tail in the beginning of Powaqqatsi - 13. The Unutterable 
	- the above instead of or in addition to rits to mark significant data boundaries?
	- think minimal, though more Reich than Glass 
	- instead of arpeggios, let the machine come up with a 1/2 bar phrase (melody and rhythm) that can be looped and cross-pollinated with variations of itself
	- maybe use progressively "bad" values to push the phrase progressively more out of shape

- more slicing and dicing of the raw data into easily digestible bite-sized chunks
- hmmm, this was just one data stream (AQI and lots of info on pollutants) - how many will we need? Hopefully we've got the hang of it now and additional data streams will offer up their pearls of wisdom faster

- windchimes: the original weather data sonification device
- made progress with minimalMelody

- I've realized that if I use 2rd party assets in Unity, I won't be able to open source the complete Unity project on github
- it would be a lot less useful if the project contains references to assets and libraries that are not included
- open sourcing a Unity project in a non-working state is less than ideal ;^/
- the answer is to remove all 3rd party assets (gulp)
- biggest loss here is Helm synth (sob)
- also losing the use of dotween, and I2 localization (groan)
- now looking into options to roll own sampler

- Tech:
- so days later still stuck on finding a good solution for replacing Helm
- fact: Unity is terrible at keeping musical time
- I've had fairly good results using a Pure Data patch via Enzien Audio Heavy as a "pacemaker"
- so clock comes from PD but sequencer is in C# Unity and samples are also triggered in Unity
- this went well until I tested on Android where timing was dreadful again
- matters are somewhat improved by reducing polyphony and latency in Unity's audio settings, but still not acceptable
- the last two days have been spent exploring the other option of doing all of the audio in PD via Heavy
- note generation will happen in C# Unity, but will be communicated to a PD patch that has the sequencer and samples
- current hangup is a 1MB limit on PD patches via Heavy, so all audio data will need to be sent to the PD patch at run-time
- alternatively find a good sounding PD synth patch, and then mix it with loops in native Unity?
- Creative:
- currently, the minimalMelody patch increases in complexity and note density as AQI values rise higher
- problem is you need a fairly high note density for it to sound good... 
- and (at least for AQI) lower values are definitely "good" and high values "bad"
- will need to rethink

- spent most of the session getting to know Unity's UI layout tools again
- is there always going to be some measure of training required for users to parse the audio data?
- I think this will be something you become better at the more time you spend with the selected scheme
2018-06-17
- UI related work
2018-06-18
- finished implementing map of Taiwan with counties selectable
- thinking of Brian Eno's Music for Airports 1/2 and windchimes
	- instead of notes in a scale playing at random time intervals (windchimes), how about notes in a melody playing in sequence at different time intervals / clusters
	- listening to Kai Schumacher's album Beauty In Simplicity [2017] for inspiration whilst working on UI
	- implementing map zooming and scrolling with mouse input (need to do the same for touch input)
2018-06-24
- spent the last number of days building a polyphonic sample player in PureData
- the PD synth I was hoping to use works on PC, but not Android for some reason
- if we can only have one instrument for generative music, piano will be best
- almost done with the sample player, but ominously the Enzien Audio website is down
- need Enzien Audio's Heavy to build the sample player for Unity and we're stuck again if Heavy is not available
- best work on some more UI things and generative algorithms with the existing sample player in the meantime
